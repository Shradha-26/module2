            <div class="text-center" id="chicken"><h3><strong>Butter Chicken</strong></h3></div>
            <p>Butter chicken is cooked in a traditional clay oven or tandoor.
               It’s first marinated in a mix of spices including cumin, turmeric, garlic and ginger,
               along with yogurt and lemon juice. A tomato sauce with butter and cream is then poured over it.
               Time and experimentation have inspired many different versions of the recipe which can be found 
               , many using a variety of different spices. Similar to Chicken Tikka Masala, 
               Butter Chicken is one of the most popular curries at any Indian restaurant around the world. 
               Aromatic golden chicken pieces in an incredible creamy curry sauce, this Butter Chicken recipe 
               is one of the best you will try! You will love how easy it is to make in the comfort of your own 
               home. Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt) Kashmiri 
               red chilli, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste.
  
               The chicken is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, 
               or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato- and 
               onion-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many 
               variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is finally velvety 
               smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and 
               fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cream may be used in the sauce or as a garnish. Cashew paste 
               may be used as a thickener and is finally garnished with coriander. The story of how butter chicken came 
               to be invented is almost as interesting as the dish itself. The Moti Mahal, in pre-partition days, was a 
               restaurant in Peshawar founded by Mokha Singh Lamba. Both Kundan Lal Gujral and Kundan Lal Jaggi worked 
               there as servers for some years. Thakur Dass was at his family’s rice and pulses wholesale business just 
               across the road from the restaurant.The Moti Mahal shut down just before partition. During these 
               difficult times, many refugees moved to areas of India because of partition, bringing their various 
               skills and culture with them. Peshawar cuisine was soon to find a new home in Delhi when the chance 
               came to revive the original Moti Mahal in the capital territory. Mokha Singh Lamba, although he was 
               then too old to continue running the restaurant, was happy for the three entrepreneurs to use the 
               original logo and gave his full blessing to the enterprise.With a growing population of Punjabis in 
               the region, there was a ready-made legion of potential customers who wanted to eat traditional 
               Peshawar fare. The trio began by selling breads and tea but then purchased three tandoors and began 
               serving fish and chicken too.There’s no doubt that the trials and tribulations that partition created 
               also forged a strong bond between the three entrepreneurs. They wanted the restaurant to work and, 
               though it took a lot of hard work with their wives earning extra money sewing, the intrepid 
               entrepreneurs put their heart and soul into the project. They finally found a shop in Daryaganj in 
               1947 and raised the funds they needed to start their tea room. As the business began to grow, their 
               fame did too. And the innovations started to come. Cooking tandoori dishes, they were presented with 
               a problem—left hanging, the tandoori dried out and, not wanting to waste anything, the team were 
               searching for a way to make the chicken more moist. While the trio of entrepreneurs has since left us, 
               their influence on Indian cuisine and Delhi as a center of culinary excellence remains. They are, perhaps 
               more than any other group of people, responsible for helping to internationalize Indian cookery and put new
                recipes like butter chicken on the map.Since it was first created back in the 1950s, butter chicken 
                has traversed the globe. you can find it in practically every town and city where there is an Indian 
                restaurant.</p>

            <div class="text-center" id="kulcha"><h3><strong>Stuffed Kulcha</strong> </h3></div>
              <p>Kulcha is made from maida flour, water, a pinch of salt and a leavening agent (yeast or old kulcha dough),
                 mixed together by hand to make a very tight dough. This dough is covered with a wet cloth and left to stand 
                 for an hour or so in a warm place. The result is a slight leavening of the flour but not much. The flour is 
                 pummelled again by hand and then rolled out using a rolling pin into a flat, round shape. It is baked in an 
                 earthen clay oven ("tandoor") until done. When baked, it is often brushed with butter or ghee, although this 
                 is not necessary. It is then eaten with any Indian curry. In particular, a spicy chickpea curry 
                 known as chole is the dish of choice for being eaten with kulcha. In the first variant, instead of using water
                  to knead the dough, milk or yogurt can be used; this results in the dough becoming softer and more rubbery. 
                  This type of kulcha is known as doodhia kulcha (milk kulcha). Leavening is often greater if yogurt is used.This 
                  variant of kulchas are not stuffed but made plain and eaten with a curry which can be either vegetarian or meat-based.
                 The second variant are the kulchas stuffed with fillings that were served during the period of Mughals and Nizams in their 
                 Darbars. Nowadays, these are sold in restaurant and shops. The Amritsari Kulcha a.k.a Amritsari Naan is well known throughout 
                 the world for its crunch and flavor. It is one of the favorite breakfast choices for the local population of Amritsar.[3] A range 
                 of stuffings, including paneer (cottage cheese), potatoes, onion and other vegetables are used to stuff these kulchas.
                Amritsar, a city in Punjab, is famous for its Amritsari kulchas or Amritsari naan where many of these varieties are 
                available. In Hyderabad, India, kulcha is also referred to as naan or sheermaal. This is a punjabi recipe. It is a type of Indian bread. 
                It is a meal in itself and is full of calories. This recipe seems like it is complicated but is very easy to make and once you try it 
                you will always make it with your curries. You can eat these delicious kulcha with any curry or just plain with amli chutney or just 
                dahi/curd.

                <div class="text-center" id="chocolate"><h3><strong>Chocolate Marquise</strong></h3></div>
              <p>Chocolate marquise is a rich chocolate dessert made with dark chocolate, butter, sugar, cocoa powder, eggs 
                and cream. It may be flavored with vanilla and espresso. This ultimate chocolate mousse cake may be my favorite dessert. 
                It keeps so well you can freeze it for up to a month, then when someone drops by, you can instantly pull it out of the freezer 
                and offer a slice. Also, it’s so easy to make but looks difficult and “restauranty.” It’s wonderful with softly whipped cream, 
                but you can doll it up with a drizzle of chocolate syrup or a spoonful of cherry, blackberry, strawberry, or raspberry sauce. 
                It can be refrigerated rather than frozen, but it’s more difficult to slice and doesn’t last as long, What, you may ask, is a 
                chocolate marquise? It’s a dessert worthy of royalty, one that defies precise description yet holds a distinct air of aristocracy. 
                It combines the richness of ganache with the velvety smoothness of mousse and, as if that wasn’t enough decadence, it adds the melty 
                coldness of ice cream. After all those sensuous adjectives, it may be worth noting that the oldest written mention of biting into a 
                chocolate bar was found in a letter written by the Marquis de Sade. The Marquis is a perfectly smooth frozen mousse. Chocolate Marquise 
                is a classic French restaurant dessert recipe made with eggs, dark chocolate and heavy cream. Indulge in this chocolaty delight which is 
                ideal for occasions like festivals.
